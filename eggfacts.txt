I don’t know. Depends on the egg.
Hello! An egg has roughly the same amount of shell material, regardless of how large the egg is. Smaller eggs have denser shells, and are thus less likely to crack!
Eggs are body temperature when first laid. As they cool down the contents contract, forming an "air cell" at one end. As the egg ages, the albumen dehydrates and the air cell expands. This is why that dumbass trick with floating eggs to guess the age works. 
Europeans don't refrigerate their eggs because they don't wash them as we do in the USA. Washing eggs removes the protective cuticle layer, but also provides a much more sanitary shell and a longer overall shelf life. Europeans also tend to buy fewer eggs at a time, and are less averse to shit on their eggs because they all practically live in barns anyway.
An average American commercial egg farm produces about a million eggs per day!
Americans, despite being fat as the living fuck, only consume about an average of 286 eggs per person per year. Mexico is closer to 345 each, for comparison. Be more like Mexico.

Egg shell color has absolutely nothing to do with nutrition, taste, or any of that shit. It's based on the color of the chicken's earlobes. Also brown hens are way more chill than white leghorns.

If your egg carton says "No Hormones, ever!", look for the little * next to that claim showing the disclaimer. It's been illegal to give chickens hormones since the 50s, so that claim means about as much as a label that says "NOW without any strychnine!"
There are three consumer grades of Eggs -- AA, A and B. AA and A only differ by interior freshness, while grade B eggs will be allowed a few interior and exterior defects such as rough or misshapen shells. Grade B eggs are almost exclusively sent to breaking facilities to make liquid egg products.

The small white twisted strand anchoring the yolk is called the "Chalazae." It is forbidden to speak this word aloud, as nobody knows how it is actually pronounced. We fear it may summon an ancient evil.
Iowa, to the surprise of nobody, produces the most eggs of any US State. Nevada, in contrast, produces no eggs whatsoever as they have not yet actually discovered that they exist.
You, an absolute buffoon: Which came first, the chicken or the egg? Me, a zen egg monk sitting serenely under a tree: An Orb Has No Beginning.

Shirred Eggs: *Saute spinach mushroom and garlic together in butter, place into a ramekin *Crack a raw egg on top of the spinach mixture, top with parmesan cheese and a bit of cream. Season with salt pepper and paprika *Bake at 400F for 12-15 minutes or until whites are cooked and yolk is still a bit runny *Sprinkle with chives, eat by dipping crusty bread into it
Easter isn't the biggest time of year for egg producers anymore. The holiday season, with all of the baking and holiday parties, is the highest sales point for eggs, yearly.
Professional egg touchers can often tell if an egg is cracked from the sound generated by gently tapping two of them together. This is called "belling", while you are called "a bell-end".
In the 1800s, this lady pretending to be a witch pranked a bunch of idiots with eggs. She wrote "Christ is coming" on eggs using acid, then jammed them back up in the chicken (wtf lady). When the hen laid it again in front of other people, they freaked the fuck out.
The following are real things: Lash Eggs, Fart Eggs, Cock Eggs, Wind Eggs, Addled Eggs, Mended Eggs, or Eggs laid inside other eggs.

in the chicken slaughterhouse I started in 12 years ago, they sold halal chickens. they're supposed to be blessed by an imam. but hiring the actual imam to come in and recite prayer was too expensive, so they recorded his prayer and played it over the loudspeakers while they ran the halal chickens. they do the same thing now with my smoochy noises in egg factories

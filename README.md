# eggbot
A silly Discord bot I made for a small server I hang out in. Original functionality
was to react to posts containing the string 'egg' with an egg emoji and to print
egg facts on command ('!facts'). For a while it asked 'How much does he bench?'
on a small chance when someone typed a word like 'guy' or 'brother'. I tried
to expand it to be gender-inclusive and think I forgot to test the regexes because
it hasn't done that in a while. Since then I've added a trigger for it to insult 
users on a small chance by taking the longest word in a message and replying with 
"You're a <word>!". It also now prints ASCII wizards when '!wizard' is called.
Important stuff.
